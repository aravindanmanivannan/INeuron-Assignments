    "7. What line of code would you add to your software to disable all logging messages?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans : getLogger('my-logger') logger. propagate = False # now if you use logger it will not log to console. This will prevent logging from being send to the upper logger that includes the console logging. Save this answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans : One of the advantages of using the logging module to track our codes is the ability to format the messages based on our needs. For example, in my code, I would like to log the date and time with appropriate messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans : Step Over is used for debugging the test steps line by line, but when the procedure is called, the entire procedure call will be executed as single step. The cursor never gets inside the procedure. Step Out: Step Out will enable, only after the debugging cursor gets inside a procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "10.After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop ?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans : Continue execution, only stop when a breakpoint is encountered. Set the next line that will be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the concept of a breakpoint?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans : In software development, a breakpoint is an intentional stopping or pausing place in a program, put in place for debugging purposes. It is also sometimes simply referred to as a pause."
